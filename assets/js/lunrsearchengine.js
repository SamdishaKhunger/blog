    "body": "2022/01/06 - Each Indian’s eyes would light up undoubtedly, when asked about their dream India as everyone have certain aspirations when it comes to their own country. India, which has had a history of struggles, became independent in 1947. It was a joyous time although gripped with horrors of partition, of poverty, of underdevelopment. But today, as we celebrate 75th year of independence, things have changed. We have progressed in many arenas, but also have retrogressed in some. Nevertheless, we all aspire for better. MY VISION @2047: Economic Domain: India would become a developed country by the time it celebrates its 100th independence day. The problems of unemployment and poverty would be solved and India would excel in world trade. Social Aspect: India would be free from the social evils crippling it. A country where all people are true to their own self, where women have complete freedom and respect, where there is harmony among diversity, is my dream India. Science and Research: India would be a home to numerous groundbreaking innovations. The Indian defense system will become puissant. India would also excel in other fields such as medicine, industrial development, etc. International Arena: India of my dreams would be leading the global space. India would have a greater say in the world affairs. Administrative and political: India would have a strong administrative and political system whose motive will be to work for Indians. India would lead the world as the largest democratic power. Clean and green: By 2047, my country would be a clean and green one. India will be a pollution free country, beautified by the greenery of vast stretches of trees, inhabiting diverse flora and fauna. It is my vision that my country is a peaceful and happy place for Indians, who have great respect and love for their country. "

    "title": "Individualism: Self-love or Selfish love?",
    "body": "2021/12/30 - We all have heard the terms such as individualism, feminism, westernism and so on. But many-a-times we have a wrong notion of such concepts as we don’t have an in-depth knowledge of the same. Through this article let us try to understand one such concept, individualism, in a better way. What is Individualism?: Individualism means complete independence to make one’s own decisions and being self-reliant (i. e. , dependent on one’s own self). You are unique is what is meant by Individualism. It is basically prioritizing yourself over others. Individualism is all about clarity and control over your own thoughts and decisions. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary,  Individualism is a doctrine that the interests of the individual are or ought to be ethically paramount. Even Rig Veda has references to individualism stating that all the things, the entire world and even the Gods are for the sake of Self, i. e. , for the individual and he/she has to decide his/her own path. Individualism can have different meanings when considered with respect to the society (where it means your interests outweigh the interests of society), politics and economy (where it implies the concept of laissez faire, i. e. , having a capitalist economy and non-interference of the government), etc. Individualism and Self-love: Self-love refers to love for one’s own self. It is appreciation for oneself regardless of the shortcomings. Self-love implies accepting yourself the way you are and loving yourself. Now that we know the exact meaning of both individualism and self-love, we can comprehend that both do not imply the same thing. Individualism is independence and self-reliance, whereas self-love is just the art of loving yourself. A person who practices individualism does not necessarily mean he would love himself and vice-versa. But it can also be true that a person who believes in Individualism is a self-loving person. It is a very subjective thing and varies from person to person. In general, if we try to understand both the concepts, we can see that these two are different. Is Individualism Selfish love?: Selfishness is not being considerate of the feelings of others and only caring about yourself. Individualism is when one does not prefer the interference of the society when he/she takes decision, which is not being selfish. It is completely a person’s choice to consider other people’s opinions while making a decision for oneself. Individualism can many-a-times be confused as selfishness or selfish love for oneself. There is indeed a fine line between the two. Individualism, as we have seen is prioritizing yourself and your thoughts over others but it does not and should not be associated with being a selfish person and only seeking one’s own advantage or well-being. It is just that we are giving importance to an individual and his/her individuality which should never be considered as being selfish. Final Word: Thus, it can be concluded that Individualism is neither purely self-love or selfish love. Many-a-times these concepts can be seen as overlapping each other but we shouldn’t consider individualism as self-love or selfish love per se. "

    "body": "2021/12/25 -       Download PDF Version  Abstract: The aim of the research is to find the status of drainage and cleanliness in urban slums based on a detailed study of the slum region on the outskirts of Muradpur in TarnTaran, Punjab. A survey was conducted in the slum area using questionnaire and observation to reveal the current status of drainage and cleanliness. Secondary data from CENSUS OF INDIA 2011 and newspaper articles has also been incorporated to back the findings in the survey. The result shows that the situation is extremely poor in the slum region with no proper provision of a drainage system or cleanliness. Keywords: Urban slums, cleanliness, drainage, India Introduction: Fast-paced urbanization shows the growth of population in urban areas. This has led to many problems, increase in density of people in an area being the prominent one. According to the CENSUS report of 2011, “There has been an increase 3. 35 percentage points in the proportion of urban population in the country during 2001-2011”. As a result of this, many people are forced to live in slum settlements which lacks adequate basic infrastructure.  Many problems are associated with this such as sanitation, clean water, drainage etc. This research focuses on two of these problems faced by slum dwellers of Muradpur(developed in 1991-2001) i. e. , cleanliness and drainage. Methods: There are two types of data collection in this research: primary and secondary data. The primary data is collected through an in-house survey of the slum region using open questionnaires. Random sampling was done and the population consisted of people of diverse ages and both males and females were included. The secondary data is collected from various sources, such as, CENSUS OF INDIA 2011, various government websites, newspaper articles, consultancy report of SAI Consulting Engineers Pvt Ltd for PUDA, Mohali, Punjab, etc. Result and Discussion: Drainage: In the slum of Muradpur (home to 1242 people, living in 253 houses), there is no proper provision for drainage. There are no channels or system through which waste water can be discharged. There is a pool of stagnant water which has been there for a long time. The water in there is completely black. 75% of the respondents replied positively when asked whether they or any of their family member have any disease because of lack of proper drainage and cleanliness. Some of them even said that water-borne diseases and stomach problems were common among the families residing there.     Further, the residents do not have any regular supply of water. They arrange water from households outside the slum area. The waste water is discarded out in open itself. During the rainy season, the condition worsens as the entire locality is filled with rain water. Not having structured streets and drainage makes it very difficult for the people to carry out their daily activities. The Tribune, dated 5 Nov 2018, quoted, “Residents say that they have requested the officials concerned of the Municipal Council many a time, but to no avail. Sewage accumulation in streets is a common sight here. The streets are already dilapidated and, due to it, some spots have turned into a pond. ” Cleanliness: Entire area of the slum is dirty and filled with waste material. As we enter the area, we can see piles of waste scattered here and there. There is no provision of public washrooms or toilets. No community toilets with or without bath are available. No community dustbin is available in the entire area. As shown by the pictures below, people throw their waste in open. There have been no efforts from municipal committee to clean the area timely and regularly.         No timely spray of mosquito repellant is carried out, which becomes a big problem for the dwellers, especially in the rainy season. There is no help from the government or any other organization or anyone to help improve the situation of the area. There is no medical practitioner with any degree in the area. No medical shop can be found. “The slums have poor living conditions as they lack in basic infrastructure like water supply, sewerage and drainage network, vehicular access, proper solid waste disposal system, street lights, community spaces, and the social infrastructure” quoted the consultancy report. Conclusion: The problem can be summarized as follows: the entire area of the slum does not have the provision of basic amenities, the dwelling condition of people is extremely bad, and there is no initiative by anyone to improve the living conditions of the people. Based on the results of this study, recommendations can be made that government must pay attention to the needs of the people living in slums and do the needed.

    "body": "2021/12/16 - We all must have heard this proverb at some point in our lives. If not, I guess you were not paying attention during the English lecture at school 😁. I am not sure about you, but yeah we were made to learn these proverbs(which tbh I used to hate learning). But now as I see, these proverbs have a lot to say, and we have a lot to understand. In this article, I am gonna talk about one such proverb:  “Watch the donut, not the hole. ” Meaning: In very simple words, it means that we need to focus on what all things we have in our lives, not the ones that we don’t have. A donut is actually complete in itself, but if it starts to focus on the emptiness or the hole in it, it’s obvious that it’ll feel sad. We humans are the same. We all are unique. We all have flaws and nobody is perfect in this world. But if we continue to focus on the flaws and feel sad and distressed about it, we might end up not liking or even dispising ourselves. And the above mentioned saying reminds us to watch the donut, i. e. , to focus on our strengths, and to embrace our shortcomings. What I learnt from this: I believe we all are striving to get to know ourselves, to love ourselves the way we are, the way God has made us. We all have different struggles in life. But despite all these things, have you ever imagined what keeps us going? You might think it is our efforts, hardwork, dedication etc. It could be on a narrow level but let’s have a look at the broader picture. A few days ago I was feeling low and my father shared a video with me. I would like to share its teachings with you all because it really had a great impact on me. It explained: We are a part of this vast universe. Practically, we are a very insignificant part of it. There might be many things going on not only on our Earth and elsewhere as well but we don’t even have the slightest idea about it. How things fell in place for us to even survive, how each and everything evolved and how we are now living? We don’t have any answers! Here, I just wanna say that we should be grateful that we are living, able to breathe and even able to think. There are numerous things that we are unaware of but it has never even come to our mind. What we mostly focus on is what other people have and not on what we have. The way we define ourselves might not be the actual us. My advice: I know this is easy to say but difficult to implement. What I advise is to begin slowly and steadily. Let us try to know ourselves. It’s not a matter of hours or days. It might take months or even years to undertand ourselves. Also, keep in mind that it is important to befriend yourself to have a peaceful mind. Many a times it is not success but the peace of mind that can bring you happiness and it comes only if you are friends with your own self. Final word: I would like to conclude this article by sharing a quote that I wrote recently:                                                                                                             You can't change the way you look, BUT you can change the way you look at yourself!       I hope you get my point. In this article, I just wrote what came to my mind, so consider sharing your thoughts about it in the comments :) Thanks for reading till the end. I post regularly on diverse topics such as life lessons, motivation, economics etc. And I must add here that a set of amazing articles are about to come in the near future, so stay tuned for that.

    "title": "Zero Opportunity Cost - Is it possible?",
    "body": "2021/12/11 - The short answer to the question is YES! We can have certain cases of ZERO OPPORTUNITY COST in Economics. But in order to understand this, we need to have a clear picture of some concepts. What is opportunity cost? “Opportunity cost in economics is the value of an item in its next best alternative use. ” or “Opportunity cost is the next best alternative that is foregone. ” I know this might sound difficult to understand, but it is a very simple concept :) Let us continue the story of Venessa from the last article. If you don’t remember her, have a read here:                                                                                         What-How-Why of Economics                    This article explains the basics of economics: what is economics, its history, how should we approach it and its importance.       You can grasp this concept better if you have a prior knowledge of the basics of economics, which is the topic of discussion of that article. Now, coming back to Venessa, if she choses to spend those 1000 bucks on purchasing Netflix subscription, she won’t be able to purchase the books as she only has Rs. 1000 (resources are scarce). In other words, she has to forgo the books in order to get the subscription. Now, the cost of the books which she has foregone is the opportunity cost of the subscription as for her, the next best alternative is the books. Opportunity cost of the subscription for Venessa = cost of the books. Similary, consider the case where you have to choose between 3 jobs, paying you Rs. 15000, Rs. 7000 and Rs. 20000 respectively. As a rational person, you would choose the job paying you Rs. 20000 per month. Here, if you didn’t have the option of Rs. 20000, you would have gone for the Rs. 15000 one. So, the opportunity cost for choosing a job paying Rs. 20000 per month is Rs. 15000 as Rs. 15000 is the amount you would have earned if you didn’t have a job worth of Rs. 20000. Now, that we have understood what opportunity cost is in Economics, let us see how we can have a case of Zero Opportunity Cost in Economics. Zero Opportunity Cost? 🤔Yes, opportunity cost can be zero in economics! Think of it, why does the concept of opportunity cost arise in the first place? It arises because resources are scares. Plus, they have alternate uses. If resources didn’t have alternate uses, we would have used them to do one task only. Then, we wouldn’t be studying opportunity cost or even Economics at all! If resources were not scarce, that is if they were abundant, we won’t have to think before using them. But yeah, we do have some abundant resources for which we have zero opportunity cost! I think y’all would’ve guessed them till now. If we look around, we have abundant sunlight, water, air, etc. For these things, we don’t have any opportunity cost! To consume sunlight, air, water, etc. , we don’t have to forgo anything. These are called free goods. But yeah, it doesn’t end here, we need to keep a few points in mind. Free goods VS Economic goodsFree goods are those goods which have no opportunity cost attached to it. They are available to us in abundance, i. e. , their supply is greater than their demand. They have no price. Whereas, Economic goods are those goods which have an opportunity cost attached to it. They are scarce. Their demand is greater than their supply. They do have a price. Effectively, only free goods are the ones with no opportunity cost. But, we must not forget the fact that the rate at which we are exploiting our environment, some of these abundant free goods might not remain free and might move to the category of Economic goods. What’s free for you might not be free for someone elseWe must also bear in mind, if a good is available to us for free, it doens’t mean it is abundant or it has no opportunity cost. For instance, while consuming a public place such as a public park, we might think it is free but someone (government, organisation, or be it anyone) has to pay for its maintenance. Let’s take another example, while attending a marriage, we eat the food but we don’t have to pay for it literally (I am not considering the gifts, money, etc. you give to them because they’re obvious 😁) But, the ones organising the marriage have to pay. So, if a thing has no price for you, it might not always be true that it’s a free good. It might be that someone else is paying to make it free for you! Final WordsThis was all about the concept of zero opportunity cost in Economics. I hope you understood the distinction between free and economics goods well.

    "body": "2021/12/01 - We all must have heard of economics and its various aspects at different points of our lives. But do we ever realise that from eating a small toffee to making big cars, hiring labour to making big policy decisions, all of these are economic activities and in fact, the subject matter of economics What is Economics?: In my opinion,  “Economics is the art of resource allocation” In order to have a clear understanding of this, let us dig deeper and understand its meaning. The english word Economics is made up of two greek words, oikos and nemein, which mean household and management respectively. It implies management of household. As we manage our household, we solve various problems in day-to-day life and make some basic rules for ourselves, similar is the case with economics. The central idea of Economics is the problem of choice. For instance, Venessa has 1000 rupees and she wants to buy a new dress but she also wants to get NETFLIX subscription. But her mom told her to buy books using those 1000 bucks. Here comes the problem of choice where she has to choose what thing to buy using those 1000 rupees. We can infer three things from this example. We all have unlimited wants. : Our wants are never-ending. It is the basic human tendency to never get satisfied with what we have. Our resources are limited: Compared to our wants, our resources are so scarce. At any given time or place, we can never satisfy all of our wants. Even if we are presented with all the resources of the world, we won’t be fully satisfied. But this is not the reason for problem of choice. For instance, imagine we have resources but we can use them only to produce cars. This poses no problem of choice. The problem arises because: Resources have alternate uses: Similar resources can be used to make cars as well as bikes. Here, we have to make a choice as to what to produce. This is the problem of choice Venessa faced. Similarly, this is the problem of choice that we all confront in our daily lives . And here comes the role of economics. It helps us understand and analyse our unlimited wants, scarce resources and evaluate what will be the best possible solution to this problem of choice to maximise our satisfaction at an individual level and at society level. Basically, it helps us at each step of resource allocation. I hope now we all are well aware of the basic meaning of economics. Let’s now dive into the past to understand it’s the origin. A brief history of Economics: The history of Economics can be traced back to the Mauryan time period. Though it might have existed before, but we are not well aware of it as there are no traceable evidences. The first ever book on Economics was Arthashastra—written by Kautilya—who was a mentor of Chandragupta Maurya (the first ruler of Mauryan Dynasty) and the Prime Minister in his court. However it is not recognised as a work of economics by many since it was a book on political economics, heavily weighed on the political side. Adam Smith, known as the father of economics, is considered to introduce all of us to the world of Economics. His book An inquiry into the nature and causes of wealth of nations, written in 1776, provides us with what is called the wealth definition of economics. There were many other economists as well who furthur added new dimensions to the concept of economics such as Alfred Marshall who gave the welfare definition, Robbins who gave the scarcity definition, etc. But even today there is no such definition that is accepted worldwide in context of economics as this is a very vast subject having varied dimensions and is much debated upon. How to approach Economics?: In my opinion, we shouldn’t be looking at economics as just a theory subject having a few laws which just needs to be crammed. In fact the way we think of economics is just like the tip of an iceberg. There are many facets of it which we might not even be aware about. Economics is a very practical subject. We can relate it to our everyday life, which makes it interesting and engaging. Whenever we associate things with our lives, we can grasp them with ease. Importance of Economics: We have already seen that Economics is a part and parcel of our lives. Hence, we must regard it with due significance. Also, having a general understanding of this subject will help us reduce the misuse of economics as well as its distrust. What I mean by this is that many a times economic figures can be used in a wrong manner and false information can be provided to the general public who is rather ignorant and tends to believe those false facts and figures. This leads to its misuse and distrust. In addition to this, knowing the very basics of this subject will only have a good influence on your life and will broaden your perspective on things. We will have a better understanding of the functioning of our government and its decisions and policies. Furthur, economics will make us aware citizens. Thus it is important and relevant for all of us to know about economics. Thanks a lot for tuning till the end. I would love to read your comments on my article :) "

Guys before proceeding further, I would recommend you to read previous article written by me:                                                                                         All you have to fear is the fear itself                    In this article, Samdisha Khunger explains how brain preceives fear and makes preconceptions regarding it and how fear is just a product of our. . .       After reading that article you will have a better understanding of this article. As we learnt in that article, our fear is nothing but a product of our own thinking. How can we control our fears and face everything courageously? Let’s find out. Here are some tips from my side. These are not just random tips. I am suggesting you these tips because these are feasible and I myself have implemented these in my life and am still following them. Basically, I am telling you this out of my own experiences. The 3F FormulaThe 3 Fs stand for  FLASH FACE YOUR FEARS Let’s take an example. Imagine you have hydrophobia(fear of water). I would say that you should go to a swimming pool or any other place convenient to you and just try entering into water for a few seconds. Take a deep breathe, calm your mind and just take the first step. I know it might sound difficult considering your fear. But guys I am saying that you just do it maybe for 5-10 seconds. In those 10 seconds you will realise that bro it is not that difficult as it seems to my brain! Slowly and gradually increase the time period. Guys, don’t force yourself. Make peace with your mind. Remind yourself that you will go through it only for a short span to see what happens. Once, twice, thrice, you do this you will understand that you can do this and by this technique you can overcome your fears. Find Yourself A MentorI know friends, the first step to ‘flash face your fears’ might seem difficult to you. If you are unable to do that, I suggest you that you should take help from some professional in that field. Find yourself a coach who can guide you. Guys, professionals are such people who know where you can face a problem or your weakness because they are are the masters of their field. Their insights can help you a lot. So, if you hesitate to confront your fears, contact a mentor and with their help you can gradually overcome your fear. Think Less And Work MoreThereafter, I want to point out a thing we all people are doing. Friends, we are always thinking and thinking, BUT not working on our fears and weaknesses. The more we think, the more our fears overpower us. Thus, instead of wasting your time thinking and subjugating yourself to your fears, work on them. Golden RulePRACTICE, PRACTICE and PRACTICEAs we talked earlier, instead of overthinking, work on your fears. By working, I mean practice and practice even more. For instance, if you have a fear of public speaking, try to speak to yourself in front of a mirror, or in front of your family members. The more you practice, the better you become. Similarly, if you hesitate to speak in English in front of others (which I guess is the most common problem with all of us), I recommend you to start from learning more about English language. As you get to learn more, it will automatically be reflected in your speaking. You can start reading books, newspaper, magazines etc. Build your vocab because that’s the basic thing. When you have more words in your own dictionary, you can easily convey your message to others in an efficient way. If you have a problem with sentence formation, try to understand from the basics. Guys, today we have plethora of knowledge surrounding us. The need is to you just make judicious use of it. You should make the best use of the available resources. Get Inspired to InspireYes Guys!!! No other motivational video/post can inspire us as much as a real life story/struggle can. Here I would like to quote an inspirational story that is currently coming to my mind. We all must have heard the name Arunima Sinha. She lost both her legs in a horrific incident, when she was thrown off a moving train. But guys, she did not give up and went on to climb the Mt. Everest (highest peak of the world). Not only that, she climbed numerous other peaks and had also played in Indian Volleyball team. She achieved all of this with her artificial legs. Think of it, if that person, with those circumstances can do it, why can’t I? We all are humans. We are the same breed.  I also have the same potential as the other person(s) has/have.  Identify Energetic People Around YouWe all have our parents and some of our friends who always cheer for us no matter what. Identify energetic people around you. Make friends only with those people who contribute to your growth. Whenever you feel low, seek help of your parents. Guys, our parents are always with us. Even if everyone rejects us, our parents will never leave us. Talk to them when you feel devastated, as they can teach you what no other person can. I remember once my father told me about Kiran Bedi ma’am (First lady IPS Officer of India). He told me that when ma’am was a child, her father always reminded her that -  There is no such thing as fear. This thing settled in her mind and we can see what a wonderful lady she is at present. So, remember, your parents and true friends always cheer on you. Whenever you want to to confront your fears, take help from your parents and friends and I am sure you will come out with flying colours! Friends, I am going to sum up this article by a quote -  Do the thing you fear to do and keep on doing it…… That is the quickest and surest way ever yet discovered to conquer fear. Thanks a lot for reading till the end! Please post your comments whether you like this article or not. I will appreciate them. "

    "body": "2021/07/15 - Hii guys!!!! Welcome to my blog. A brief introduction about me - I am Samdisha Khunger, currently, a student of 12th standard. Guys, we all are afraid of one thing or the other. We always have something which we can’t face courageously. Some have hydrophobia(fear of water), some have anthropophobia(fear of being social), etc. Our fear are our weaknesses. We all know it is very difficult for us to face our fears. Sometimes our fears get in our way to success. We need to overcome such fears so that we can attain something in our life. Let me tell you a story. We all must have read stories in school. We all had those English literature books which had different different stories or anecdotes. I am gonna tell you one such story from our English textbook. There is a writer named William O. Douglas who shared his life experience. He tells that he was extremely afraid of water as he had very bad experiences of drowning(by bad he meant a really very bad one, that once he was on the brink of death). He used to get chills when he went near water. But one fine day, he decided to face his fears!. He went to a coach, started learning swimming, using different techniques, and little by little he started overcoming his fear. It took him almost double the time one needs to learn swimming but at the end it was all worth it. Guys, as we can see, that only by confronting our fears, our prejudices against ourselves, we can get over these. Franklin D. Roosevelt once said  ALL WE HAVE TO FEAR IS THE FEAR ITSELF This is very important friends. We need to understand the depth of this quote. It is not actually that we are afraid of water(for instance), but we have a preconception in our mind based on your past experience or experiences of others. In this case we have thought in our mind that ‘I am afraid of water’. Now whenever you go near any waterbody, you remind yourself that you are afraid of water. Gradually, it settles in your subconscious mind. Your fear overpowers you and you never ever try swimming. Here I am taking example of hydrophobia but it can be the fear of anything(as fear is a subjective thing). I just wanna remind you that it is not actually that you have some allergy from water or anything, it is just that you have fed it in your mind even without experiencing it in real life. Now even if you gather some courage and try swimming, your mind will again and again remind you that you are afraid of water and you will give in to your fear. This happens with us oftenly. Actually all we have to do is to change our perception. Remind your brain again and again that  I am not afraid of water.  OR I am not afraid of anything.  You just have to face that in your mind. It is your own thoughts that you have to change. And once you convince yourself that you are afraid of it, believe me you can ace each and everything. Most of us have heard the name ROBERT PATTINSON(the twilight actor). During an interview he said I used to get so paralyzed with anxiety before auditions. I just couldn't do anything. I tried different methods to calm myself before performances but to no avail. THE ONLY THING THAT EVER WORKED IS JUST TO USE ANXIETY AS A CHARGE. I build everything from anxiety and fear. BEAR GRYLLS, the man we use to watch on Discovery channel, ‘Man vs Wild’. He said If you really want to live empowered, you've got to face all those fears. This now is about trying to control that sense of natural panic that always come. If you are not used to it, it can overwhelm people so if we breathe it down, we keep calm, focus on what we are doing.  There are numerous such examples. These are all people who have faced their fears and became successful. The biggest fight is the fight with our mind itself. Once we win that fight, everything else is easy. Guys, so don’t be afraid, tell your mind that you are invincible, and then you can easily overcome you fear and weakness. Remember– Don't let your fear of what could happen make nothing happen. Do check out the next part of this article:                                                                                         How To Overcome Your Fears?                    In this article, Samdisha Khunger explains how we can overcome our fears in any aspect of our life.       Thank you guys for reading till the end.

    "title": "The real cause behind our lack of motivation",
    "body": "2021/06/07 - Hi Guys! Welcome to my blog. A brief intro about me - I am Samdisha, currently a student of 12th standard. Guys today I’m gonna address an issue with which most of us are grappling. It is a common problem with most of us, i. e. , lack of motivation, lack of zeal and enthusiasm to work consistently towards our goal. Let’s get to the root of the problem and find out the real cause behind our lack of motivation and guys I will be giving you a bonus tip at the end, which will help uou solve this problem. Let us understand this with an example. For instance, you decided that you are going to exercise daily for an hour. What happens is, we start off very well. We are excited and motivated to exercise in the beginning. But after a few days, we find ourselves searching on youtube/google, how to stay motivated/motivational videos/inspirational videos. We spent a lot of time on it. And then we get excited again but that excitement lasts hardly for 2-3 days and this cycle goes on. Sometimes, we get so frustrated by ourselves that we leave that idea of exercising. As a result, we are never able to maintain a consistency. To think of it, I guess you guys have searched this blog for the same reason only “How to stay motivated?” So guys what is the reason behind all this cycle that goes on and on. Let us find out. Friends according to my observation and analysis, what happens is, if we are doing something consistently, we might get bored at a point. This happens because we get disinterested in that activity as we have to repeat it everyday. For instance if you are told to consume rice only, three times a day, sevem days a week, there will be a point where you will get bored even if it is your favourite dish. Similarly, exercising everyday, starts with excitement but becomes a burden when we proceed with it each and everyday. Now, guys most of us will think that we use mobile phones each and everyday and even for hours, but we are not bored of it. This is where you need to understand the “ESCAPE THEORY”, which we imply, which is also the answer to your query. Guys, what happens is if you decide to study 6 hours a day, after few days you have no enthusiasm to study because you are bored with same pattern everyday. Then you pick up your mobile phone, not because you are interested in it or you enjoy it, but because you want to escape from that pattern of yours. You want to avoid that burden which the study has created. Once you start using your phone, watching youtube videos or scrolling through social media, you get into a world which is much different from your reality(which you find boring). Obviously guys we all know that maximum things on the social media are a facade. Now, once you are on your phone, time passes and you don’t realise it as your mind is not in reality. In reality, you have to study, there is pressure on you to complete your tasks but when on phone, you don’t have to think of any such things and time passes and you don’t even realise it. Initially you do it because you start considering your tasks as a burden. Later, after a few days, when you have a lot of backlog, you start to have fear of studying as there are a lot of things that you are yet to complete. Now, you use phone out of that fear. Guys, you can even see practically. Whenever you are using mobile phone, 90% of the time, you are not enjoying it or loving it, but you are doing it to avoid the stress and burden that your work has created. Actually it isn’t the work, but we ourselves have created the stress and burden by procrastinating things. This is all about the “Escape Theory” which I mentioned earlier. Guys, I hope you have understood the gist of the problem. This was the main motive of the article to make you understand, why you lack motivation and the escape theory, which we consciously or unconsciously imply in our lives. Now guys, some bonus tip for you to help yourselves fight this problem. By the way guys I will be writing another article on “How to stay motivated?”    Guys, we must do certain efforts to engross ourselves in our work. For instance, while studying we can assign ourselves certain tasks for the day. Instead of focusing on the entire thing, we must divide it into parts so that we can focus on one part at a time.   We can make a to-do list which we have to complete within a day/a week. Now, when we have a challenge ahead of ourselves, we will be bound to complete it. We must have a strong will power and complete our tasks.     Be careful guys, you must start with short tasks according to you which you will be able to complete easily. NEVER EVER start off with impossible tasks. This will only prompt you to give up and be lazy.     When you complete your tasks, reward yourselves and appreciate your effort. Even if you are not able to complete it, never lament on it and leave it. Instead cheer yourself up to do better next day.   Guys, do have faith in yourself. You are able to ace anything and everything with your ability. The only thing is to believe yourself and go for it.  Have your goal in mind, Remember your dream, Ace your tasks everydayandBe ready to have it all. All you have to do is,GIVE IT YOUR ALL andHAVE IT ALL. Thanks guys for your precious time. Do share your ideas on this topic in comments. I will appreciate all your comments. Thank you for reading this far! "

    "body": "2021/05/28 - Hi Guys! Welcome to my blog. A brief intro about me - I am currently a student of 12th standard aspiring to crack CSE. I recently started reading novels and “Life is what you make it” is the first novel I completed. Yes, guys the first I completed. Earlier many-a-times, I thought that I should start reading different books(otherthan those taught in school) and I had even started reading a few, but I was not able to complete any such books. Then I thought that I should focus on some fiction novels, which would arise some curiosity in me and I would be hooked. This is exactly what happened. When I first started this book, I was engrossed in it. Believe me guys, it justtook me 3 days to complete it. I was even shocked with myself as before this, Ihad never even read a single book in an entire month. About the bookThis book is a fiction novel, but it is based on some true incidents. The protagonist is a young girl named Ankita Sharma and the entire story is narrated by her. Every emotion is so well portrayed that I even had tears reading certain parts. We come across the thoughts of Ankita, we see her entire growth, the ups and downs she faces in her life, and how she fights every emotion of hers. I feel that most of the people would find themselves connected to thethe protagonist at some point. That’s because, now, as of today many people feelstressed and depressed inside even if they don’t show it outside. It may not be on such extreme level as Ankita feels, but we can connect with her and learn from her experience and help ourselves in our day-to-day life. Some points have penetrated deep in my heart such as whenAnkita was on the terrace trying to take her life, her father came and he cried in front of her. The feeling portrayed by the author in this scene is so touching that you can feel the emotions. And when Dr. Madhusudan understood her condition and consoled her, that point felt deep. Below, I would provide a summary of the book. Guys, if you are interested,please proceed further. If you don’t wanna spoil it for yourself, then you can directly read the book and believe me it will be a good experience for sure. Also, on a side note, you can click on the image below or click here to buy the book.  Short SummaryThe story begins with Ankita(originally from North India) shifts to Cochin after her 12th standard as her father got transferred. The story is set in the 1980s when there were no mobile phones. People used telephones only to communicate. Further, Ankita’s parents were very strict with her. So, she was not allowed to converse on phone with her friends especially boys, and they were not allowed to enter her house. However, she had the freedom to write letters to her friends. She wrote letters to her special friends, Vaibhav whom she had feelings for. She got admission to St. Agnes in Cochin which was one of the top colleges in the country. It was an all-girls college. There she made friends with Suvi, who later became her best friend, and Janie and Charu. It was a new experience for her as she had studied in co-ed till her high school. She was always always excited to write letters to Vaibhav describing her life. But letters usually took five days to reach the other person. So they decided to have phone conversations when her parents went for morning walks. There was one time that she was almost caught by her parents but escaped narrowly. Overall, her life was going smoothly, and she was happy. When college elections took place, her friends even without consulting her, nominated her name for Arts Club Secretary and she got selected. When several activities and fests were organized, she met Abhishek, who was an office-bearer in Mahaveer, which was another co-ed college. Gradually, as they met occasionally as fests etc, she started falling in love with Abhi, who had already confessed his feelings towards her. However, she kept all this from Vaibhav and she no longer anticipated letters from Vaibhav. Her time in college passed this way. Further, she, along with her certain other friends decided to go for MBA, and they started preparing for it. When the results came, her friends could only qualify for CUSAT, she got admission to Bombay University for MBA which was a very good option for her. She decided to go for it. Fortunately, at that time only, her father got transferred to Bombay. However, Abhi wanted to spend time with her, so he told her that she should also go for MBA in CUSAT. She was not at all happy to hear this from Abhi and she told him that she is not gonna give up on her dream. When it was about a month she left Cochin, she gets to know that Abhi died because of drowning in the ocean, which was directly after the day she conversed with him. His grandfather even protected her by not disclosing her relation with Abhi and he advised her:  Never belittle love Though, she realized this later, this incident made a very deep impact on her. She then shifted to Bombay with her family and started her journey pursuing MBA degree. She made many new friends. There, she experienced many changes within her. She became hyper-active. She was very excited to the point that her senses were not in her control. She started running, sprinting, and painting, and even academically, she was on top. During this time she barely slept. In between, for a very brief period, her mind reminded her of Abhi, but she was not aware of the fact how her life had changed after all this. Then, a sudden decline in her mood came. From being over-enthusiastic for everything, she became a person with no zeal. It was like an emptiness surrounded her. There was a big void inside her. Further, to make matters worse, her parents discovered her letters she wrote to Vaibhav and the letters Abhi gave her. They were so angry seeing this that they burnt all the letters in front of her. She was devastated. How could she explain to her parents what these people meant in her life? She was now severely depressed. She did not want to attend college. She had severe panic attacks. She even tried to kill herself twice. Once, she felt terrible in her head and wanted to give this pain a physical form. So, she went to the terrace to jump from the residential building but her father came and he did not say anything to her but started crying(Guys, This was the point where even I started crying. The author portrayed the emotions so well that I could see how a father would feel helpless seeing his child in such a miserable situation) Then her parents took her to two psychiatrists. They both gave her medications,but it only made matters worse. She was then taken to NHMI, which was one of the best care for mental health in India. There she met Dr. Madhusudan explained to her that she had bipolar disorder. He consoled her saying that it was completely normal and she need not feel that burden on her. It was just like any other illness. These words calmed her. She had to stay there for about two months to recuperate. Initially, she hated being at a mental hospital, but slowly and gradually her condition improved. She made new friends there. Dr. Madhusudan played a very important role in improving her condition. She started feeling happy again. Shestarted enjoying life. In the end, we can see that she had a happy life where she got many educational degrees and even had a son and lived happily with her family having good control over herself. What I learned from this bookFriends, I would like to list a few things, which I learned from this book. Faith can do miracles in life: Guys, first have faith in yourself, and God. Even, I have personally experienced it and I would even recommend you to believe yourself. Here’s a quote which I just read today:  Believing in, receiving out This means, what we strongly believe inside, we will surely receive that outside. Never belittle love: Always cherish the love and care that people give you. Never take things for granted: Never take things for granted which you easily get in life. We must learn to value every thing we got in life, and cherish it. Celebrate every moment: Celebrate being alive. Thank God for everything. Open up about your feelings and emotions: This is the most important thing that I learned. Do not let your emotions buried deep inside. The more you express, the happier you will be. And please guys, if you have any problem, please share it with your parents or your friends. You guys are not alone. Don’t be afraid of anything. Open up about your mental health. This is all I wanna say. ConclusionFriends, these are my personal thoughts and feelings after reading this book. Please do try reading this book. I really wanna express my gratitude towardsthe book’s author who create such a spectacular piece of art. Guys, this book “Life is what you make it” even has a sequel which is “Wake Up - Life is Calling”. I have not yet read it. I will post a review on it as soon as I read it. Hope it also keeps me hooked like this one 🤞 Thank you guys for reading till the end. This is my first ever post. Please leave your views on this article liked it or even if you did not like it. I will appreciate all your comments. Thank you! "
