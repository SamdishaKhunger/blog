Hi Guys! Welcome to my blog. A brief intro about me - I am currently a student of 12th 
standard aspiring to crack CSE. I recently started reading novels and 
"Life is what you make it" is the first novel I completed. Yes, guys the first 
I completed.

Earlier many-a-times, I thought that I should start reading different books(other
than those taught in school) and I had even started reading a few, but I was not 
able to complete any such books.

Then I thought that I should focus on some fiction novels, which would arise some 
curiosity in me and I would be hooked. This is exactly what happened.

When I first started this book, I was engrossed in it. Believe me guys, it just
took me 3 days to complete it. I was even shocked with myself as before this, I
had never even read a single book in an entire month.

# About the book

This book is a _fiction novel_, but it is based on some true incidents. 

The protagonist is a young girl named **Ankita Sharma** and the entire story is narrated 
by her. Every emotion is so well portrayed that I even had tears reading certain parts. 
We come across the thoughts of Ankita, we see her entire growth, the ups and downs she 
faces in her life, and how she fights every emotion of hers.

I feel that most of the people would find themselves connected to the
the protagonist at some point. 

That's because, now, as of today many people feel
stressed and depressed inside even if they don't show it outside. 

It may not be on such extreme level as Ankita feels, but we can connect with her and 
learn from her experience and help ourselves in our day-to-day life.

Some points have penetrated deep in my heart such as when
Ankita was on the terrace trying to take her life, her father came and he cried in 
front of her. 

The feeling portrayed by the author in this scene is so touching that 
you can feel the emotions. And when Dr. Madhusudan understood her condition and 
consoled her, that point felt deep.

Below, I would provide a summary of the book. Guys, if you are interested,
please proceed further. If you don't wanna spoil it for yourself, then you 
can directly read the book and believe me it will be a good experience for 
sure.

# Short Summary

The story begins with Ankita(originally from North India) shifts to *Cochin* 
after her 12th standard as her father got transferred. The story is set in the 
1980s when there were no mobile phones. People used telephones only to 
communicate. 

Further, Ankita's parents were very strict with her. So, she was not 
allowed to converse on phone with her friends especially boys, and they were not 
allowed to enter her house. 

However, she had the freedom to write letters to her friends. She wrote letters 
to her special friends, **Vaibhav** whom she had feelings for. She got admission to 
*St. Agnes* in Cochin which was one of the top colleges in the country. It was an 
all-girls college. 

There she made friends with **Suvi**, who later became her best 
friend, and **Janie** and **Charu**. It was a new experience for her as she had studied 
in co-ed till her high school.

She was always always excited to write letters to Vaibhav describing her life. But 
letters usually took five days to reach the other person. So they decided to 
have phone conversations when her parents went for morning walks. 

There was one time that she was almost caught by her parents but escaped narrowly. 
Overall, her life was going smoothly, and she was happy.

When college elections took place, her friends even without consulting her, 
nominated her name for *Arts Club Secretary* and she got selected. When several 
activities and fests were organized, she met **Abhishek**, who was an office-bearer 
in Mahaveer, which was another co-ed college. 

Gradually, as they met occasionally as fests etc, she started falling in love with 
Abhi, who had already confessed his feelings towards her. However, she kept all 
this from Vaibhav and she no longer anticipated letters from Vaibhav.

Her time in college passed this way. Further, she, along with her certain 
other friends decided to go for *MBA*, and they started preparing for it. When 
the results came, her friends could only qualify for *CUSAT*, she got admission 
to *Bombay University* for MBA which was a very good option for her. 

She decided to go for it. Fortunately, at that time only, her father got 
transferred to Bombay. However, Abhi wanted to spend time with her, so he 
told her that she should also go for MBA in CUSAT. She was not at all happy to 
hear this from Abhi and she told him that she is not gonna give up on her dream.

When it was about a month she left Cochin, she gets to know that Abhi died 
because of drowning in the ocean, which was directly after the day she 
conversed with him. His grandfather even protected her by not disclosing her 
relation with Abhi and he advised her:

> Never belittle love

Though, she realized this later, this incident made a very deep impact on her. She then 
shifted to Bombay with her family and started her journey pursuing MBA degree. She 
made many new friends. There, she experienced many changes within her. She became 
hyper-active. 

She was very excited to the point that her senses were not in her 
control. She started running, sprinting, and painting, and even academically, 
she was on top. During this time she barely slept. 

In between, for a very brief period, her mind reminded her of Abhi, but she was 
not aware of the fact how her life had changed after all this.

Then, a sudden decline in her mood came. From being over-enthusiastic for 
everything, she became a person with no zeal. It was like an emptiness surrounded 
her. There was a big void inside her. 

Further, to make matters worse, her parents discovered her letters she wrote to 
Vaibhav and the letters Abhi gave her. They were so angry seeing this that they 
burnt all the letters in front of her. She was devastated. 

How could she explain to her parents what these people meant in her life?

She was now severely depressed. She did not want to attend college. She had 
severe panic attacks. She even tried to kill herself twice. Once, she felt 
terrible in her head and wanted to give this pain a physical form.

So, she went to the terrace to jump from the residential building but her father 
came and he did not say anything to her but started crying(Guys, This was 
the point where even I started crying. The author portrayed the emotions so 
well that I could see how a father would feel helpless seeing his child in 
such a miserable situation)

Then her parents took her to two psychiatrists. They both gave her medications,
but it only made matters worse.

She was then taken to *NHMI*, which was one of the best care for mental health 
in India. There she met **Dr. Madhusudan** explained to her that she had bipolar 
disorder. 

He consoled her saying that it was completely normal and she need not 
feel that burden on her. It was just like any other illness. These words calmed 
her. She had to stay there for about two months to recuperate.

Initially, she hated being at a mental hospital, but slowly and gradually her 
condition improved. She made new friends there. Dr. Madhusudan played a very 
important role in improving her condition. She started feeling happy again. She
started enjoying life.

In the end, we can see that she had a happy life where she got many educational 
degrees and even had a son and lived happily with her family having good control 
over herself.

# What I learned from this book

Friends, I would like to list a few things, which I learned from this book.

## Faith can do miracles in life

Guys, first have faith in yourself, and God. Even, I have personally experienced 
it and I would even recommend you to _believe_ yourself. Here's a quote which 
I just read today:

> Believing in, receiving out

This means, what we strongly believe inside, we will surely receive that outside.

## Never belittle love

Always cherish the love and care that people give you.

## Never take things for granted

Never take things for granted which you easily get in life. We must learn to 
value every thing we got in life, and cherish it.

## Celebrate every moment

Celebrate being alive. **Thank God for everything**.

## Open up about your feelings and emotions

This is the most important thing that I learned. Do not let your emotions buried 
deep inside. **The more you express, the happier you will be.**

And please guys, if you have any problem, please share it with your parents or 
your friends. **You guys are not alone.** Don't be afraid of anything. Open up about 
your mental health.

This is all I wanna say.
