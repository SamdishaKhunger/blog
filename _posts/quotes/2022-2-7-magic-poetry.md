<center>
I started believing in magic,<br/>
when suddenly one day<br/>
air whispered in my ears,<br/>
to let go of all the worries.<br/>
That day, the clouds smiled at me<br/>
and gave me strength.<br/>
The sun taught me<br/>
to shine as brightly as I can.<br/>
That day was the day,<br/>
nature healed me<br/>
and since then,<br/>
I confine all my worries<br/>
to these new friends.<br/>
That day was the day magic happened<br/>
and has been happening since then.
