Hi Guys!!!!!

Welcome to my blog. A brief introduction about me - I am Samdisha Khunger, a student of 12th standard. 

In this article I am gonna help you overcome your biggest fears and prejudices against your own self.

Guys before proceeding further, I would recommend you to read previous article written by me:

{% for post in site.posts %} 
    {% if post.title == "All you have to fear is the fear itself" %}
        {% include postpreview.html %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

After reading that article you will have a better understanding of this article.

As we learnt in that article, our fear is nothing but a product of our own thinking.

*How can we control our fears and face everything courageously*? Let's find out.

Here are some tips from my side. **These are not just random tips**. I am suggesting you these tips because these are feasible and I myself have implemented these in my life and am still following them. Basically, I am telling you this out of my own experiences.

# The 3F Formula
The **3 Fs** stand for

<pre><center><b>"FLASH FACE YOUR FEARS"</b></center></pre>

Let's take an example.

Imagine you have *hydrophobia*(fear of water). I would say that you should go to a swimming pool or any other place convenient to you and just try entering into water for a few seconds. 

**Take a deep breathe, calm your mind and just take the first step**. I know it might sound difficult considering your fear. But guys I am saying that you just do it maybe for 5-10 seconds.

In those 10 seconds you will realise that bro it is not that difficult as it seems to my brain! 

Slowly and gradually increase the time period. Guys, **don't force yourself**. Make peace with your mind. 

Remind yourself that you will go through it only for a short span to see what happens.

Once, twice, thrice, you do this you will understand that you can do this and by this technique you can overcome your fears.

# Find Yourself A Mentor

I know friends, the first step to 'flash face your fears' might seem difficult to you. 

If you are unable to do that, I suggest you that you should take help from some professional in that field. 

Find yourself a coach who can guide you. Guys, professionals are such people who know where you can face a problem or your weakness because they are are the masters of their field. Their insights can help you a lot.

So, if you hesitate to confront your fears, contact a mentor and with their help you can gradually overcome your fear.

# Think Less And Work More

Thereafter, I want to point out a thing we all people are doing.

Friends, **we are always thinking and thinking, BUT not working on our fears and weaknesses**. The more we think, the more our fears overpower us. 

Thus, instead of wasting your time thinking and subjugating yourself to your fears, work on them.

# Golden Rule

<pre><center><b>PRACTICE, PRACTICE and PRACTICE</b></center></pre>

As we talked earlier, instead of overthinking, work on your fears. By working, I mean practice and practice even more.

For instance, if you have a fear of public speaking, try to speak to yourself in front of a mirror, or in front of your family members. The more you practice, the better you become.

Similarly, if you hesitate to speak in English in front of others (which I guess is the most common problem with all of us), I recommend you to start from learning more about English language. 

As you get to learn more, it will automatically be reflected in your speaking. You can start reading books, newspaper, magazines etc. 

Build your vocab because that's the basic thing. When you have more words in your own dictionary, you can easily convey your message to others in an efficient way.

If you have a problem with sentence formation, try to understand from the basics. Guys, today we have plethora of knowledge surrounding us. The need is to you just make judicious use of it. 

You should make the best use of the available resources.

# Get Inspired to Inspire

Yes Guys!!!

No other motivational video/post can inspire us as much as a real life story/struggle can. 

Here I would like to quote an inspirational story that is currently coming to my mind. 

We all must have heard the name **Arunima Sinha**. She lost both her legs in a horrific incident, when she was thrown off a moving train. 

But guys, she did not give up and went on to climb the **Mt. Everest** (*highest peak of the world*). Not only that, she climbed numerous other peaks and had also played in Indian Volleyball team. She achieved all of this with her artificial legs. 

Think of it, **if that person, with those circumstances can do it, why can't I?**

<pre><center><b>We all are humans.<br />We are the same breed.

"I also have the same potential as 
the other person(s) has/have."</b></center></pre>

# Identify Energetic People Around You

We all have our parents and some of our friends who always cheer for us no matter what.

Identify energetic people around you.

Make friends only with those people who contribute to your growth.

Whenever you feel low, seek help of your parents. Guys, our parents are always with us. Even if everyone rejects us, our parents will never leave us. Talk to them when you feel devastated, as they can teach you what no other person can.

I remember once my father told me about **Kiran Bedi** ma'am (First lady IPS Officer of India). He told me that when ma'am was a child, her father always reminded her that - 

> There is no such thing as fear.

This thing settled in her mind and we can see what a wonderful lady she is at present.

So, **remember**, your parents and *true* friends always cheer on you.

Whenever you want to to confront your fears, take help from your parents and friends and I am sure you will come out with flying colours! 

Friends, I am going to sum up this article by a quote - 

> **Do the thing you fear to do and keep on doing it...... That is the quickest and surest way ever yet discovered to conquer fear.**

Thanks a lot for reading till the end!
