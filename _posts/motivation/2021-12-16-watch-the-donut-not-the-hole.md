We all must have heard this proverb at some point in our lives. If not, I guess you were not paying attention to during the English lecture in the school 😁. 

I am not sure about you, but yeah we were made to learn these proverbs(which tbh I used to hate learning). But now as I see, these proverbs have a lot to say, and we have a lot to understand.

In this article, I am gonna talk about one such proverb:

> "**Focus on the donut, not the hole.**"

## Meaning

In very simple words, it means that we need to focus on what all things we have in our lives, not the ones that we don't have. 

A donut is actually complete in itself, but if it starts to focus on the emptiness or the hole in it, it's obvious that it'll feel sad. We humans are the same.

We all are unique. We all have flaws and nobody is perfect in this world. But if we continue to focus on the flaws and feel sad and distressed about it, we might end up not liking or even dispising ourselves. 

And the above mentioned saying reminds us to focus on the donut, i.e., to focus on our strengths, and to embrace our shortcomings.

## What I learnt from this 

I believe we all are striving to get to know ourselves, to love ourselves the way we are, the way God has made us. We all have diffrent struggles in life.

But despite all these things, have you ever imagined what keeps us going? 

You might think it is our efforts, hardwork, dedication etc. It could be on a narrow level but let's have a look at the broader picture.

A few days ago I was feeling low and my father shared a video with me. I would like to share its teachings with you all because it really had a great impact on me.

It explained:

We are a part of this vast universe. Practically, we are a very insignificant part of it. There might be many things going on not only on our Earth and elsewhere as well but we don't even have the slightest idea about it. 

How things fell in place for us to even survive, how each and everything evolved and we are now living? We don't have any answers!

Here, I just wanna say that we should be grateful that we are living, able to breathe and even able to think.

There are numerous things that we are unaware of but it has never even come to our mind. 

What we mostly focus on is what other people have and not what we have. The way we define ourselves might not be the actual us.

## My advice

I know this is easy to say but difficult to implement. What I can say is let's begin slowly and steadily.

Let us try to know ourselves. It's not a matter of hours or days. It might take months or even years trying to undertand yourself.

But what I have come to understand is that it is important to befriend yourself to have a peaceful mind. Many a times it is not success but the peace of mind that can bring you happiness and it comes only if you are friends with your own self.

## Final word

I would like to conclude this article by sharing a quote which I wrote recently:

{% for post in site.posts %} 
    {% if post.excerpt == "You can't change the way you look, BUT you can change the way you look at yourself!" %}
        {% include postpreview.html %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

I hope you get my point. In this article, I just wrote what came to my mind, so consider sharing your thoughts about it in the comments :)

Thanks for reading till the end. I post regularly on [diverse topics](/categories) such as life lessons, motivation, economics etc. And I must add that a set of amazing articles are about to come in the near future, so stay tuned for that.
